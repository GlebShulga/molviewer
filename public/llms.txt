# MolViewer

> Interactive 3D molecular visualization tool built with React and Three.js

## What This Application Does

MolViewer is a free, open-source web application for visualizing 3D molecular structures. It allows scientists, students, and researchers to:

- Load molecular structures from PDB files or fetch directly from RCSB PDB database by ID
- View molecules in multiple representations (Ball & Stick, Stick, Cartoon, Spacefill, Surface)
- Apply various color schemes (CPK elements, Chain, Residue Type, Secondary Structure, B-factor, Rainbow)
- Measure distances, angles, and dihedral angles between atoms
- Compare multiple structures side-by-side or overlaid
- View amino acid sequences with secondary structure annotations

## Key Features

- **File Support**: PDB, SDF, XYZ molecular formats
- **RCSB Integration**: Enter a PDB ID (e.g., "1crn", "4hhb") to fetch structures directly
- **Representations**: Ball & Stick, Stick, Cartoon (ribbon), Spacefill (CPK), Surface
- **Color Schemes**: Element (CPK), Chain, Residue Type, Secondary Structure, B-factor, Rainbow
- **Measurements**: Distance (Angstroms), Angle (degrees), Dihedral angle
- **Multi-Structure**: Load up to 10 structures, overlay or side-by-side comparison
- **Sequence Viewer**: Interactive amino acid sequence with secondary structure color coding
- **3D Labels**: Add persistent labels to atoms
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history support (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)

## Technology Stack

- React 19
- Three.js / React Three Fiber
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Usage Examples

1. Open the application
2. Click "Load from RCSB" and enter "1crn" (crambin protein)
3. Select "Cartoon" representation to see secondary structure
4. Use "Secondary Structure" color scheme
5. Click the sequence viewer to highlight residues in 3D
